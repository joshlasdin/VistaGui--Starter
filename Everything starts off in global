Ok, trying to figure and document the layout process.
1. Everything starts in global.
2. Global.root is where the start of everything is listed.
The view gives us the regions:
tag specified by r-header is completely replaced (why use a class and not an ID?) by the header view (global.header.view)
tag specified by r-body has stuff inserted (the r-body tag is NOT replaced)

Can we add a sidebar region here for this as well?

Everything starts off in global
The global root view lists the regions that will be managed.
